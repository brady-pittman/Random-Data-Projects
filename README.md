## degrom_data
Messing around with graphs and data from statcast, focused on Jacob deGrom

6/20/2023 (K+GB+Soft) - (BB+Barrel's+Hard) rate of MLB Pitchers. Can be done year by year too, just have to download the specific tables from fangraphs

## pga
Trying to use BeautifulSoup to grab live leaderboard updates for a specific list of players. Does not work

## pitcher_performance_index
A mess of a program doing some wird pitcher calculations for my own stat. Have to manually enter the data right now.
