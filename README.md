Collection of random data projects

## degrom_data
Messing around with graphs and data from statcast, focused on Jacob deGrom

## pga
Trying to use BeautifulSoup to grab live leaderboard updates for a specific list of players. Does not work

## pitcher_performance_index
A mess of a program doing some wird pitcher calculations for my own stat. Have to manually enter the data right now.
