Messing around with graphs and data from statcast, focused on Jacob deGrom

2015+: (K+GB+Soft) - (BB+Barrel's+Hard) - max_innings/pitchers innings same as desirability_rate, but with a slight punishment for throwing less inngings

Trying to use BeautifulSoup to grab live leaderboard updates for a specific list of players. Does not work
