## degrom_data
Messing around with graphs and data from statcast, focused on Jacob deGrom

## desirability_rate
6/20/2023: (K+GB+Soft) - (BB+Barrel's+Hard) rate of MLB Pitchers. Can be done year by year too, just have to download the specific tables from fangraphs

## desirability_rate_tbf
(K+GB+Soft) - (BB+Barrel's+Hard) + (0.04 * tbf_deviation) same as desirability_rate, but with a slight bonus or penalty for batters faced compared to the league average. This is for one year, change the 0.04 to 0.02 for 2015+. It is probably best to seperate data into starters and relievers as it is hard to compare the two due to large gap in batters faced.

## pga
Trying to use BeautifulSoup to grab live leaderboard updates for a specific list of players. Does not work

## pitcher_performance_index
A mess of a program doing some wird pitcher calculations for my own stat. Have to manually enter the data right now.
