Messing around with graphs and data from statcast, focused on Jacob deGrom

## desirability_rate
6/20/2023: (K+GB+Soft) - (BB+Barrel's+Hard) rate of MLB Pitchers. Can be done year by year too, just have to download the specific tables from fangraphs

## desirability_rate_tbf
2015+: (K+GB+Soft) - (BB+Barrel's+Hard) +(0.04 * tbf_deviation) same as desirability_rate, but with a slight bonus or penalty for batters faced compared to the league average

## pga
Trying to use BeautifulSoup to grab live leaderboard updates for a specific list of players. Does not work

## pitcher_performance_index
A mess of a program doing some wird pitcher calculations for my own stat. Have to manually enter the data right now.
